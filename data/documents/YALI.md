# YaliLauncher!
This document contains **almost** everything about YaliLauncher! Below will be a very long document...

## 1. Overview
YaliLauncher is a application for Minecraft hosting, and to clarify: **NO**, YaliLauncher is not a server hoster, it is a SELF-hosting server app that also lets you manage your server while still letting you normally use it without the launcher.

YaliLauncher aims to make hosting, managing, and customizing Minecraft servers as easy and flexible as possible, while giving users full control over server software, plugins, worlds, and settings—all from a single, user-friendly UI.

YaliLauncher uses various APIs to fetch the ``.jar`` files for these servers. YaliLauncher does not collect any data or reveal any data, the most it does is install the server for you, it does not even have a backend to collect data on. YaliLauncher is not affiliated with Mojang, Microsoft or any of the people/teams who made these platforms.

YaliLauncher will be updated pretty often but not too often, will mostly be updated for patch updates, additions or new Minecraft versions.

YaliLauncher supports many platforms for Minecraft installing, this includes:
- Vanilla
- Bukkit (requires you to use BuildTools)
- Spigot (requires you to use BuildTools)
- Paper
- Purpur
- Folia
- BungeeCord
- Waterfall
- Velocity
- Fabric
- Forge (requires you to use their own installer)
- NeoForge (requires extra installation steps)

## 3. Installation & requirements
This app only works on **Windows**!
If you are here from the app, you have already installed it. If you are from the GitHub repo or somewhere else, heres how to install it:

1. Open the ```.exe```.
2. Your already done!

YaliLauncher also has some requirements and also shows you some recommended for running your server. YaliLauncher requires as minimum these to run properly, this is including the app **and YOUR** server! This includes:

- Minecraft (what are you running a MC server for if you dont have MC...)
- A "AMD Athlon 64 X2" processor (most likely)
- 1 GB of DDR3 RAM (your server will struggle extremely below this)
- Windows operating system (Windows 10 or higher)
- JVM/Java runtime + Java 8 or higher
- Internet access (Wi-FI)
- Screen size of 960x540 or higher (wont display properly if not larger)

Nothing else is required and if there is, it is probably an actual system requirement. However YaliLauncher recommends these for the best server experience:

- A "AMD Ryzen 5 5600X" processor (not the best but it works good)
- 6 GB of DDR4 RAM
- Windows 11
- Java 8 (or whatever Java version your server is required to run on)
- Ethernet, 50 mbps or higher + 45 ms or lower (depends on how many players)
- Screen size of 1280x720 or higher

## 5. Question answering
Questions will be answered down here!

- Will any more platforms be added? - Probably not as we already support pretty much all the major platforms. If there is any more additions then Arclight, Quilt and SpongeVanilla are the next targets to be added probably.
- What plugins/mods does it automatically install? - Axior, Eventron, Multimedia and/or FoliaPerms, depending on your platform. For Fabric, automatically installs Fabric API for you guys.
- Can I manage multiple servers - Not at one time, but if you have multiple instances of YaliLauncher, you can technically achieve this but this is **not** recommended.

## 6. For the developers
YaliLauncher is made entirely from the coding language, Python. 

If you would like to contribute, contact me with the contacts above! You must know how to code in Python, must must must because that's what the app is programmed in!
