# Licensing! (and usage..)
This is about all the licensing info for YaliLauncher and its other software! I am not affiliated with any of these people/companies listed below or Microsoft. All of the external APIs do not belong to me, so follow their rules and licensing.

## 1. YaliLauncher's law
YaliLauncher's code is licensed under **GNU General Public License v3**, meaning it is open-source code. However this license could change sometime in the future. You can find it's repository [here](https://github.com/kaiakkyt/yalilauncher).

You are allowed to redistribute YaliLauncher since it is under GPL v3 code BUT before you do, you must agree to the several specific conditions: 
- Provide the license text: A copy of the full GPL v3 license must be included with every copy of the software.
- Source code availability: If you distribute compiled binaries (object code), you must also provide the corresponding source code in a machine-readable format at no extra charge.
- State changes: You must provide prominent notices stating what modifications were made to the original code.
- No further restrictions: You cannot add extra terms or technology (like some forms of Digital Rights Management or DRM) that would prevent users from exercising the freedoms granted by the GPL v3.
- Patent Protection: The license explicitly grants users patent rights from contributors, protecting users from patent lawsuits related to the use of the GPL-licensed software. 

If you fail to comply with this and I find out, legal action could be taken...

## 2. Initial plugin installation
All plugins that are installed into your server automatically are created by me!
Meaning: Axior, Eventron and FoliaPerms are all owned by me.
But they have different licensing:

Axior and Eventron is licensed under **GNU General Public License v3**, meanwhile FoliaPerms is licensed under **MIT**.

If you want to know their licensing or wanna find anything about them, visit my GitHub repos [here](https://github.com/kaiakkyt?tab=repositories)!

## 3. APIs
YaliLauncher uses various external API's for server downloading and addon downloading. These include:
- Mojang (vanilla)

- Purpur
- Fabric meta
- BungeeCord Jenkins
- Forge Maven
- NeoForge Maven
- Modrinth (to download plugins/mods)

## 4. Audio
The UI click sound was found on [GameDevMarket](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/free-ui-click-sound-effects-pack) but heavily modified by me!

The background music ("Yalia") is owned by me, which for all my music, I use **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0**, so you can use it even **commercially** as long as *I* get credit for it!
